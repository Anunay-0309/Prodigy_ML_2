# 🛍️ Prodigy ML Task 2 — Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## 📌 Task Description

**Goal:**  
Segment mall customers into groups based on their **Annual Income**, **Spending Score**, and **Age** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.

**Dataset:**  
[Mall_Customers.csv](./Mall_Customers.csv)

---

## 🧾 What This Project Does

This project:
1. Loads and explores the mall customer dataset.
2. Uses the K-Means algorithm to find **customer groups (clusters)**:
   - **2D Clustering:** Based on Annual Income & Spending Score.
   - **3D Clustering:** Based on Age, Annual Income & Spending Score.
3. Visualizes the final clusters so it’s clear how customers are grouped.

---

## 📊 Results

**✅ 2D Cluster Plot**
- Shows how customers group together based on their **income** and **spending habits**.
- Each color means a different group.

**✅ 3D Cluster Plot**
- Adds **Age** to see how it affects the grouping.
- Shows the same clusters in 3 dimensions for deeper understanding.

Check the final plots in the [`plots/`](./plots) folder!

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload the **CSV** and **notebook** to Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Make sure the CSV is in the correct path (`./Mall_Customers.csv`).
3. Run each cell step by step.
4. Save the cluster plots as PNGs to use in reports or presentations.

## ✅ Done!

This clustering helps mall managers understand different customer types — useful for **marketing**, **discounts**, and **personalized offers**.
